PercasTest

A simple 2D hexagonal map generator built with Unity.
Each time the player presses Left Mouse Button (Mouse 0), the system generates a new map with randomized elements such as:

Hexagonal tiles (procedurally placed)

NPC (randomly spawned)

Walls (Block path)

Goal point (for navigation)

This project is mainly for testing procedural generation concepts and pathfinding.
